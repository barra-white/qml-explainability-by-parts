    "# Feature Map\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum feature map is a method used in QML to encode classical data into quantum states. This allows QML algorithms to take advantage of quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to process data in a high dimensional space, allowing quantum algorithms to uncover patterns in data that would be difficult for classical algorithms to detect."
